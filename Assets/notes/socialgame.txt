social game
its people in rooms
you have to manage your time to talk to people and make friends
at the end of the day/week you must sacrifice one of your friends to continue
^ this is a result of a curse

talking to people is represented by a small version of consolidarity
- radius of 1, so theres 7 tiles
- each tile represents a point/tenet of the discussion, so you're literally conceding on certain ones to bolster ones you want more (EX: giving up on getting a health bonus to make them like you more)
- either side wins when they have a majority of the tiles in the game? that might be good BUT also victory changes meaning depending on which tiles you won!
- each unit/set of units/some units are emobidemnts of your actual friends in the game, their unique characters, that you obtain by befriending them 

your main resources are time, relationships, probably fatigue, and maybe money?
it all takes places in one map (one city? one town?) where it takes time to go between rooms and so you have to make decisions like (do i stay in this room with people that dont like me or spend time to go to another where they like me more to get better chances)

you obvi sleep each night (maybe theres a push your luck mechanic with sleeping, idk)

people will hate you. especially if/when they learn you're the reason people are being sacrificied. when people hate you, maybe that adds a shittier unit to your set?

tile ideas
- losing tile makes the convo take more time
- losing tile makes you lose (more) money (you pay for drinks lol)
- winning tile makes their friends like you a little more
- winning tile gives you more friendship points
- winning tile gives you a special item/bonus/money?
- winning tile means they owe you a favor 

unit ideas
- move twice
- can hop over center?
- counts as two
- can push allies/rivals
- can pull allies/rivals
- no one new can enter same tile
- no one can leave same tile
- the longer it stays in a tile, the more it counts as
- the less it stays, the more it counts as
- swap tiles (but not units) across the center
- unit that can't  stop moving?
- unit that can't move in the same direction it did last time it moved
- unit that can't go back to a tile its been in before
- unit that can only move to the 3 across from the center

basic unit concepts
- weird movement
- move others
- control whether people can enter/leave that tile
- restrict other's movements
- length of time in a tile

unit code concepts
- chosen unit can move to different tiles than normal
- non-chosen unit can add/remove tiles to where chosen unit can move
- 

maybe the way active abilities work is that after using it, you can no longer move that unit?

code order
- 


do 2 radius map (maybe start with less tiles and tiles get added by players?)
maybe befriending people works more like mentors in going under (gives you simplified unit, abilities, tiles) (maybe tiles give you powers?)
tiles are worth differing points maybe?
maybe different _end_ condition, then you score the tiles
new units come in for both sides once per turn
when a side runs out of units to come in, they've lost
you have 2 actions per turn
you can:
- move a unit
- activate a tile with a unit

thers also passives

you can probably get rid of enemy units? idk
