goal of the game is to learn the language and to uncover the secrets of the place and to escape the village

its like heaven's vault meets wandersong!!

you're in a small village inside of a giant animal

you're learning words and then having to use them to ask questions of the creatures in the village

you communicate by changing your head into the glyph you want to use

everything has a name that is stationary and you are able to change them by changing their names (there somsetihng to limit this)
- people (jan): their names are just jan + mods for them
- 

you have little magic stone circles that you put the glyph on and then put the circle on the object to change it and you have to take it back to be able to use it again

you get more circles later
you also either get different sized circles OR all your circles upgrade to be able to put more symbols

you learn symbols by encountering them for the first time

ITS KINDA LIKE BABA IS YOU BUT WITH A STORY AND YOURE LEARNING WORDS


TODO:
- figure out
-- names?? (for game will not be the usually bar thing)
-- can you get to every word in 2 steps?
-- how to gamify
-- long pi?
