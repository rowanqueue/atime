hex based grid
you play a team of scouts
MAJOR GAMEPLAY
-choosing your scout team
--they need to be paid
--you want their desires to match yours
-taking care of their wants and needs
--they need rations, morale, health
-exploring on the map
-- fog of war as a base
-- events can pop up?
-- interact with other units on the map?
-- discover RESOURCES, NATURAL LANDMARKS, SETTLEMENTS
-MINI EXPLORING
-- you zoom into a location and then perform actions there for a goal
-- EXAMPLE: you must climb a mountain to be able to claim it/see further/obtain items
-- EXAMPLE: you investigate a village and talk to its people to learn about them and buy goods
-- EXAMPLE: you find samples of a resource (like ore) and where to mine for your Empire
-sending info back to the civilization to get money for your next excursion

TIME SCALE
Each turn is a week
Each month is 4 weeks
Each year is 4 months
So 16 turns is a year? Yikes
maybe the scouts want to be paid monthly?
maybe you have to pay a fee monthly?
maybe you have to report something monthly?
Assume the average number of years someone would work is 30 total, thats 480 turns which is a standard game of civ v so probably like 10 hrs??
