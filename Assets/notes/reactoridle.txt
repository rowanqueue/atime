airplane roguelike
you have a limited amount of turns in the air
each tile can have a wind direction that moves you along your normal move
you can make up to a 90 rotation in one turn
you land on the tile you're facing
you're trying to find treasure to upgrade your airplane so that you can go further
(the area is an archipelago)
(little airfields are like checkpoints)

you can pick up missions at different stations
- delivery (deliver BLANK to a specific station)
- pickup (get specific order from another place)
- find missing thing (go to last known location and try to find the thing)

TILES
- land or water
-- land
--- empty
--- airport
-- water
--- empty
- weather
-- wind direction
-- storm

a medium island is around 6-8 tiles

plane stats:
- battery: how much energy can you take
- engine: how much you can carry for one energy
- cargo hold: how much you can carry TOTAL


your WEIGHT LIMIT is how many pounds you can carry per unit of energy.
ex. say your engine can carry 25lbs/1L of fuel. if your weight is 25 or less you only need 1L to move, but if its higher it's going to cost more fuel (1.5? 2?) to make each move

WAYS TO "LOSE" (RESET RUN)
- run out of energy
-- in air, you crash
-- on land, you have to pay to get your plane to the nearest station
- run out of supplies (only checked at the end of each day (a day is just going from taking off to landing))
-- if not at a station, you have to distress to nearest station
- crash - wake up at center base with 10% money gone lol

ELECTRIC PLANE

you fly out of the center base to find stations/scout the world to find money through treasure or doing jobs. you spend that money on upgrading your plane so you can go further and do more things.

RESOURCES
- fuel - you need this to keep your plane in the air
- supplies - you need this to advance a day outside of center base
- treasure - sold/used for more complicated upgrades
- parcels - you deliver these!
^ these take up weight

- money - you need this to buy things (like all the other resources and upgrades)


SETTING
you're on a sea city (think solarpunk) in the middle of the ocean, trying to make a living using the only thing you own, an old glider


GAMEPLAY
- explore new places to uncover wind patterns 
- chart paths and make/change plans to avoid moving storms
- find treasure/secrets on undiscovered islands/man-made places
- make deliveries to stations
- upgrade your plane to be able to go further and carry more!


------
math patterns
- constant addition (+1,+2,+n) ex. 1,2,3,4,5
- constant subtraction (-1,-n) ex. 10,8,6,4,2,0
- constant multiplication (x2,x3,xn) ex 1,2,4,8,16
- constant division (/2,/n)

SHIT THAT FALLS
CURRENT DESIGN
colors 1-5
same colors can combine
when they combine, each individual piece weighs the same as the number of pieces in the group
everything crushes weight -1
board has a weight and height limit
if you reach the height limit, you lose
if you reach the weight limit, you lose layers until you're under the weight limit, then weight limit continues (this is like levelling up basically)

WORST PART? the way things combine
what if falling pieces are goop and then they solidify (crystallize?) in some way
what if once there is a group of 3 it crystallizes the first turn its not touched again
non-crystallized blocks are their weight and not special
crystallized blocks are solid and can only move down if all the bottom blocks can move (weight is the combined weight), and can only be crushed by something heavier than its combined weight, and it cracks and breaks the whole crystal


a 7x7 grid
you morph grids into you
your "health" is how many blocks you are
you lose blocks from "attacks"

tile-based mushroom 11

ok its twinfold but you're trying to get to the other block to add it to your group without losing too many blocks

no enemies, only environmental things

you WILL always lose blocks, you're trying to lose the least

twinfold but its all about weird lines between grid points

concepts:
- empty
- wall :blocks you
- thorns: hurts
- river: takes you to the end of it
- 
 yeah so you start as one block and then blocks are destroyed by environmental effects and its assumed you will lose one trying to get one (MAINTAIN), and you gain gain more by getting them in different ways

so the basic idea is that the level changes and you now see your goal and you have to get to it and so you navigate in a way that hopefully only removes one of your blocks

example of destruction obstacles:
- wall/tile that destroy blocks that go through/land on them
- moving entity(not enemy) that destroys blocks
- block stealers!
- player can manually cut off blocks and they become obstacles after a certain time
- holes the player can fall in if their whole body is over them

there are different types of obstacles
- collision: this prevents the player from moving
- destruction: this destroys a block
-- cut/remove: this removes a block
- rotation: this rotates the player
- reposition: this moves a specific block on the player
- 

ooh fun effects
- reposition parts of your body (BUT THE REPOSITIONING HAS RESTRICTIONS)

literally twinfold in that its 4 directions + special powers (BUT THE SPECIAL POWERS ARE The BLOCKS You GET)

the grid is made up of


ok so you each room is a 5x5 grid and each time it respawns theres an extra wall

there is a shape on the ground that if you eyeball is on and you double tap, you enter the next room where the wall number resets and only goop thats on the 

IDEAS:
- the next room is below you, so you go downwards through a drain marked on the floor
its really not that fun to make yourself match a certain shape

it is fun to have to manuever yourself to attach all the pieces
what if different pieces had different effects?
what if its like a deckbuilder
each turn 2 blocks spawn and you choose which one to add
theres victory blocks that you can use to reset the wall number
theres special ability blocks (rotate self, swap eye position, destroy wall)
theres negative blocks


goal: fill entire board with yourself
when you fill up, the whole grid you were in becomes one grid in the next grid

everytime all the bits are attached, walls reset and add one

you can reduce wall number by sacrificing good blocks

wall number is also reset when you enter the new grid

whats different about different grids?

levers
- wall number
- types of goop that spawn
-- positive
-- negative
-- neutral
- obstacles
-- walls
--- walls that block movement
--- walls that allow movement, but block connection
-- tiles
--- tiles that do weird stuff



what if you could pick up a ball and move it around in your goop and get it to a specific position

what if its spelunky?
filling up a grid is a region, then the next region is designed around different obstacles and abilities

possible abilities
- move the eye
- freeze 1 cell before next movement
- reduce wall number by 3 (basically it stops being cost efficient the 2nd/3rd time you use it)
- destroy wall
- destroy unconnected bit

abilities increase their cost each time they use it, reset at grid reset
ability costs are the number of times you've used it that region +1, plus a certain amount of extra based on the ability


goop ideas
- goop with different values for abilities
- goop with different defence (fire, ice?)
- goop that makes certain abilities cheaper



loop
a cell pops up and you grab it and when all cells are attached, walls reset +1
once you fill up the entire grid, grid becomes a single cell, wall number resets, player gets new ability

simplest version
2 goop spawn with new walls, eat one, other poofs, wall number++
do this until you fill the entire grid
now wall number resets, you choose an ability and an obstacle to start appearing
you can only use an ability if you've eaten one of its goop since the last time you used it + the other goop needed for its cost


what happens if the player hits both goop at the same time? they get both! (you always want to do this lol)

abilities you're able to do appear at the bottom, greyed out if you can't do them yet

simplest loop
goop spawn, eat one, wall number++
kill goop, reset wall number (try to go as long as possible without doing this to get more points)
fill up, new grid, wall number resets, choose new obstacle, repeat above

player actions:
- swipe to move
- sacrifice a cell to reduce wall number (the number of cells you crush goes up until you fill the grid)
- undo

wall ideas
- normal wall
- sieve wall (stuff goes through but disconnects)
- snake wall (a wall of length (3-5) that moves around like the game snake)
- bouncy wall (if goop tries to go through wall, it tries to move opposite direction)

tile ideas
- hole (if more of you is over a hole than not, all of you over the hole falls in) (if you cover the hole completely, everything over the hole falls in)
- rotating tiles (so their walls change basically)
- trap! (you hit it and it becomes enclosed on 4 sides until you hit the pressure plate that opens it)
- ice tile that makes goop slide
- sticky (that goop doesn't move until next wall reset)

either?
- portal wall or tile would be interesting
- diagonal wall (pushes the piece diagonally?)
- diagonal wall (pushes the piece perpendicular)
- goop wall (wall that connects to connected goop)

lets actually try
- sieve wall
- bouncy wall
- moving wall (maybe snake, maybe it just goes in a straight line?)
- rotating tile
- slidey tile
- sticky tile


ok so
- non-player goop that is connected (harder to get)
- think more about the base walls

maybe unconnected goop becomes sentient after a while?


ok so either
1. there is a BAG and the player is choosing what to add to that bag
2. there are REGIONS and the player is choosing which region to go to next

what about 1 themed like 2?
BAG has 16 walls, 16 tiles
each region end gives you 2 or 3 options for what to add to the bag
either
1. add new thing
2. increase chance of old thing


lets start with pre-determined
before weird walls, you need walls
before rotator, you need walls

CHOICES
+ WALLS
+ STICKY
+ SPIN
+ PONGWALL
+ GOOPWALL
+ SLIDEY
