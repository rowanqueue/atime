-commit to games based on evidence: prototypes or free versions, fans, sequels
funding

-publisher handles marketing, PR, support, platform relations, certification
-marketing commitment weak?
publishers

-many are okay with cold email intros with or without pitches
-get an intro from someone who's already been published
-you'll need an estimate of a monthly budget

nyu incubator hooked me up with a good lawyer on the 80 page contract

lots of different publisher relationships
publisher is like dating

bring lowest 1099 to financial aid person at hospital to get medicaid

50-50 after recup is fair
publishers want tangible/playable/viewable (proof of concept)

studio week
AAA
interview process, what to do with an offer
don't submit??
do i want _that_ job?
larger scale means your contribution is less
can be frustrating to work at low-level after working at high-level here
seniority transfers!!
nothing is more powerful than an organic connection
have opinions about the studio's games
read interviews of their devs
research their products and cultures
what roles make up teams?
^ look at credits
know how the business works? - how do they sustain themselves and grow?
aaaah
start applying in april
portfolio: things that feel complete
interview
most likely on-site, all day interview
come prepared
ask about interview schedule
sincere questions for interviewers
only enter 10 minutes earlier
dress as yourself, dress one notch above what you see people in the studio wearing
follow up to recruiter: mention things you learned that excited you
got an offer
make sure offer is reasonable and within industry norms (compared to igda salary survey)
think about benefits
don't worry about their toys
develop life outside of your organization
relocation costs? (pretty much only if more experience)
how often is salary reviewed?
what opportunities for growth?
what turnover?
negotiate
accept with conditions, decline unless terms
play offers against each other
saying no, say no, no ghosting
get the job
do your work
ask questions
seek to understand your responsibilties
ask for job description
exceed expectations
don't overuse internal social media (slack)

finding people who are excited about mentoring folks inside the organization
automate tasks
identify other work

working in games industry has always been bad
-job instability
-low pay/long hours
-unpleasant work conditions
