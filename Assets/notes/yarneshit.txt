- desktop: move camera by putting mouse at edge of screen
- mobile: move camera by swiping
- but like do this in a way it doesnt wipe saves lol 
- ok but how does going to other menus work if they're movement based

+ woovit yes, maybe ads later 
+ how do we add levels to the game in a non-linear format? this is a post 50 problem
-roadmap
- steam achievements
- resolution resizer
- cloud saves
- better exit process (button)
- trading cards

ARMORGAMES

- talk to parker about updating it

MARKETING
- woovit
- youtubers!!
- maybe pay for ads? (like ~$400?)

NEXT UPDATE
- erase big save
- reset level save
- put a world name as the level name in level select mode
- resolution scaling
- better exit process? (button)
- right click needs to be taught better
- accessibility to make it so you don't have to hold down your mouse
- accessbility : more obvious walls
- more intricate volume settings
- credits button on menu
- steam achievements
-- page 1/2/3/4
-- certain number of moves
-- if we add separate saves, speedrun >:)

UI/MENU OVERHAUL
- reset level button (you unlock it so players dont become degens)


- power button
- clear your progress (potentially multiple saves?)
- more intricate volume settings
- credits from menu
- resolution resizer (maybe just fullscreen/not with a resizable window?) ( we can save the size of their window for when they boot up)



DREAMS
- final palette thats unlocked by doing everything
- level editor (how to have N levels?)
- palette editor (how to have N paletttes?)

MOBILE MAY 10thish
- deal with phone resolutions
- how to make mobile attractive to steam customers?
- replace mouse animation with finger animation
- release same time as endless mode on pc
- set up landscape mode in a way that permits playing from a portrait perspective

- trans pride flag
- sandy stone

- marathon : hardcore endless
- level editor + play other people's levels




LINES
-- mirror line where its two of the shape in the middle and you drag them and they both go (one is mirrored)
-- mirror but its just for individual moves (less like mirror, more like sprouts out of the same opening?)
-- dashed line (you can intersect some)
-- spiky line (it has to end where another one starts?)
-- wavy line (it it can only make 2 degree turns)
-- double strong shape (you have to strecth it twice to go down one side)
-- explosion (when it ends, it covers every other connection in the hex)
-- line that when pull it in a direction it either:
	1. cant go the same direction for the next move
	2. makes a WALL in that direction
EDGES
-- walls (you can't go through that)
-- holes (you can go through, but can't stop?)
-- terminators (you can end on it only)
-- arrow edge (you are pushed through the hex)
-- warps (teleport from one edge to another unconnected edge)
-- one way edges
-- key edge that when fulfilled opens all other edges in tile
-- grower edge
-- goal edge (you HAVE to go through it to satisfy the level)
TILES
-- inner walls blocking certain connections
-- tiles that need to be filled >= or <= to be satisfied
-- splitter tile (splits into 2)
-- lock and key tiles (not touching)
-- walls between vertices that split tile into 2
-- tunnel in the middle of a tile
VERTICES
-- a vertex that has to be surrounded
