one screen zeldalike
- only movement
- 10x10 screen
- you have health (HP) but each turn you move takes away 1 HP
- you're trying to get to the exit
- if you die, you respawn at the start and board state resets
- you go out but a ghost of what you did also goes out
- you/ghost pick up stuff when they run into it (but if you pick it up on turn 5, die, then ghost picks it up on turn 5 in your next run)
PICKUPS: more health, equipment, etc.
- its all about getting equipment so you can traverse better as well as maintaing your health
- there are enemies which hurt you for HP
- if you have a weapon, you can hurt them back (basically remove them? maybe they have variable HP?)
EQUIPMENT IDEAS
- sword (lets you attack enemies for 1 HP)
- shield (takes away 1 HP from attacks)
- jumpy boots (you can jump over walls/ledges)
- floaty cape (you can fly over holes?)
- PICKUPS
-- more health

todo:
- make a grid
- make a player move
- player health + obstacle takes away health
- player die reset
- player ghost
- ghost pick up
- work on pick ups
- work on exit



asteroid digging hex game (kinda like motherload)
gravity is the center of the asteroid
lets explore this movement/grid system, then figure out game 
- what if its like... use the whole asteroid to make a little garden so you can escape (use gravity to water plants, maybe?)
