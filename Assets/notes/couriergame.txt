its like that rabbit carrying bunnies game

its like a metroidvania where you can only have a certain number of abilities at a time (its like if you could only carry a few charms at a time in hollow knight) (you have to get to a checkpoint to swap out abilities)

you physically hold the abilties in your hands (you get more hands to be able to use more abilities at the same time)

some charms you have to physically create by bringing together multiple pieces in one place or refining a material somewhere

NOTHING YOU PLACE IS PERMANENT! only permanent changes can be made by denizens of the dream (dreamizens)

abilities
 -pushing things
 -throwing things
 -dashing
  -balloon (floaty dash modifier)
 -heavy (a bunch of weight)
 -sprinting
 -carry more
  -carry objects (fire torch, ice torch, ladder)
 -astral project (you can leave your body and fly for recon)

obstacles
 -pit(you can dash over or push a block into it)
 -block(you can push it or later destroy it or even later astral dash
  -heavy block(you need to be heavier to push it)
  -wooden block(you burn it if you have fire)
 -water(you can dash over or push a block or freeze)
  -river(moving water) if you block or freeze, it can "overflow" and       knock you off
  -wooden bridge? carry a torch over it and it burns

THERE IS NO WAY TO GO HIGHER besides terrain (ladder/ramp/stairs)

ideas
 -the heavier you are (from carrying more charms/cargo), the slower you   go
 -some things you carry have time limits (ice/fire?), so you want to be   faster 

everything has simple traits:
 -temperature: you can freeze water or burn
its top down and you can dash over pits

similar level setup to worble!
maps gonna be crazy, it automatically places the links (which are neurons) for the player

the player can tag different chunks with ability tags
