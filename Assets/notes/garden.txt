4 plants
Buttercup: -> 2M
Wild Rye: 5M >0.5L -> 1N
Dogwood: 1N >0.5L -> 50M
Tree: 100N 200M -> 125N -0.1L

NEW SYSTEM: Light
if a plant cares about light, they want a certain number then up to 1 or down to 0
EX: dogwood needs light, so it wants >0.75
EX: mushroom needs dark, so it wants <0.25

so, you plant enough buttercups to get wild rye
use the nitrogen from wild rye to grow some dogwood
use the nitrogen from wild rye and moisture from dogwood to grow a tree
tree produces nitrogen and reduces light
eventually tree makes it impossible for dogwood/rye to grow, meaning you need to replace the moisture you've been getting from the dogwood

ok so the concept is basically that your middle plants start dying and you're running out of moisture to support your trees so you need to replace them

therefore the light problem basically becomes a moisture problem
fern takes a bunch of nitrogen and makes it into a little bit of moisture
only problem is that its just a stopgap, it won't actually keep your trees from dying
thats when it basically becomes a race: can you get enough trees to block out enough light to get mushrooms to feed your ferns so they can make enough moisture for your trees! thats the challenge

2 plants
Fern 10N <0.5L -> 7M (its really bad at making moisture lol)
Mushroom 2M <0.25L -> 5N

first beat: growing a tree from scratch requires intermediate plants
second beat: too much <resource>! 
suprise second beat: tree erodes its supports by killing them


light lets us teach the concept of plants being able to kill each other early on


individual zones have a marker where if a factor goes above it it starts killing plants that produce that factor

pollution as a factor
plants check physical trash gameobjects in a density around them like the adjacency system

ZONE: 1000M, 0N
too much water, you gotta consume it somehow
throw down some wild rye

the biomass cost is different than the biomass score, that makes sense!
